    "Taiju Oki (大おお木き大たい樹じゅ Ōki Taiju) is one of the protagonists of Dr. Stone. He was depetrified on October 5th, 5738 AD. Together with Senku, he nobly aspires to rebuild the lost human civilization by depetrifying everyone caught in the phenomenon that happened 3,700 years ago. Along with Yuzuriha, he joined the Tsukasa Empire, where they would eventually work as spies for the Kingdom of Science until their victory and both factions merged. After rejoining the Kingdom of Science, he is placed as the leader of the Farming Division, while being an asset to the Power Team for his inhuman amounts of endurance. He and Yuzuriha followed Senku as valuable members for the Kingdom's journey towards Treasure Island and America until the second global petrification. Following the seven-year timeskip with the Kingdom and the American Colony resolving their differences, he and Yuzuriha resumed their duties to complete and succeed the Kingdom's moon project where they finally married in the story's finale.", 
    "Yuzuriha Ogawa (小オ川ガワ杠ユズリハ Ogawa Yuzuriha) is one of Senku's best friends and the love interest of Taiju. Before petrification, she was a high school student and a crafts club member. She was depetrified in 5739 AD. Along with Taiju, she joined the Tsukasa Empire, where they would eventually work as spies for the Kingdom of Science until their victory and both factions merged. She and Taiju followed Senku as valuable members of the Kingdom's journey towards Treasure Island and America until the second global petrification. Following the seven-year timeskip with the Kingdom and the American Colony resolving their differences, she and Taiju resumed their duties to complete and succeed the Kingdom's moon project, where they finally married in the story's finale.", 
    "Tsukasa Shishio (獅子王司 Shishiō Tsukasa) is the former primary antagonist of Dr. Stone. He was the antagonist of the first several arcs, his goal being to thin out the human population in order to create a new world without modern technology for the pure-hearted youth. Despite his claims that no threat would come after Senku and Taiju, which proved ironic,[12] Tsukasa became one of the biggest obstacles to Senku's Kingdom of Science and restoring humanity as a whole in general. In order to fight and prevent Senku from establishing a scientifically advanced civilization, he goes on to found his own society comprised of strong warriors to further his agenda. Eventually coming to a stalemate, he forms a temporary truce with Senku after the latter proposed to save his sister and, having reaffirmed his promise to never again let Senku be harmed, ultimately defeats the traitorous Hyoga along with him. After his life was saved by Senku by de-petrifying him from his cryogenic state, Tsukasa joins the Kingdom of Science and embarks with them on their trip to the United States, channeling his ideals differently - yet still striving for a morally pure world without exploitation of the innocent.", 
    "Kohaku (コハク) is a young woman who is a descendant of modern humans. She is Ruri's younger sister and the daughter of Kokuyo. She is one of the protagonists of the series. After meeting Senku and witnessing his bravery, courage and talent, Kohaku invites him to her village. Since Senku assists and fascinates the village with many of his scientific inventions and turned out to be the savior the village ancestors talk about in the stories that are passed down, the population is ultimately rallied to fight and stop Tsukasa's tyrannic empire. After Taiju, Kohaku is the most loyal to Senku. Since learning about science, and the delicate, complicated work it takes to make modern inventions, Kohaku often teams up with Chrome to scavenge ingredients and 'persuade' Kinro and Ginro to help with the labor.", 
    "Chrome (クロム Kuromu) is the alleged sorcerer and future scientist of Ishigami Village. Originally a rival, he grew close to Senku as the de-petrified human taught him the art of science. He is one of the protagonists of the series. Having been fascinated with nature's resources since a young age, Chrome was always interested in experimenting with different materials despite having little to no knowledge about humanity's achievements and compounded scientific knowledge over thousands of years. As part of the Kingdom of Science, Chrome serves as the unofficial right hand of Senku; this trust is what makes him one of the Five Wise Commanders. He is also the only post-petrification human among them. Gifted in both natural science and inventing, Chrome tends to alternate between making chemicals with Senku and building with Kaseki."
